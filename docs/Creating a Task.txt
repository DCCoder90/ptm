| Creating a Task |
-------------------

The task manager is capable of handling a large number of tasks and quickly and
efficiently running them all in sequence.

Just placing PHP code in the tasks directory is not enough for the task manager
to recognize it.  All tasks follow a strict naming convention.  When creating a
task be sure to name the file TASKNAME.task.php and place it in the appropriate
file.

Please use the following template to create your own tasks:

<?php
class TASKNAME extends Task{
	function run(){
		CODE TO RUN TASK HERE
	}
}
?>

Also not that your task may have more then one function in them, however the
task manager will only run the run() function, therefore it is important that
this function be included in all of your tasks otherwise and exception will be
thrown.

Tasks may store information within the Task Manager for use in future tasks.
Please refer to the Usage.txt file in the docs directory on instructions of
how to accomplish this.
